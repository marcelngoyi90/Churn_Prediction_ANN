# Customer Churn Prediction with ANN

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn (whether a client is likely to leave) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. 
It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.  

---

## Motivation
Customer churn prediction helps businesses reduce losses by identifying at-risk clients.  
With early detection, companies can act proactively with retention strategies.  
This project was also an opportunity to strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, ANN model building, and deployment with Streamlit, while solving a real-world business problem.
